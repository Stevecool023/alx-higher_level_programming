middle_word should contain the value of the variable word without the first and last letters


8. Create a new sentence
mandatory

You can find the source code here
You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statements
Your program should be exactly 5 lines long
You are not allowed to create new variables
You are not allowed to use string literals


9. Easter Egg
mandatory
Write a Python script that prints “The Zen of Python”, by TimPeters, followed by a new line.

Your script should be maximum 98 characters long (please check with wc -m 9-easter_egg.py)


10. Linked list cycle
mandatory
Technical interview preparation:

You are not allowed to google anything
Whiteboard first
This task and all future technical interview prep tasks will include checks for the efficiency of your solution, i.e. is your solution’s runtime fast enough, does your solution require extra memory usage / mallocs, etc.
Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list has a cycle in it.

Prototype: int check_cycle(listint_t *list);
Return: 0 if there is no cycle, 1 if there is a cycle
Requirements:

Only these functions are allowed: write, printf, putchar, puts, malloc, free


11. Hello, write
#advanced
Write a Python script that prints exactly and that piece of art is useful - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line.

Use the function write from the sys module
You are not allowed to use print
Your script should print to stderr
Your script should exit with the status code 1


12. Compile
#advanced
Write a script that compiles a Python script file.

The Python file name will be stored in the environment variable $PYFILE

The output filename has to be $PYFILEc (ex: export PYFILE=my_main.py => output filename: my_main.pyc)


13. ByteCode -> Python #1
#advanced
Write the Python function def magic_calculation(a, b): that does exactly the same as the following Python bytecode:

  3           0 LOAD_CONST               1 (98)
              3 LOAD_FAST                0 (a)
              6 LOAD_FAST                1 (b)
              9 BINARY_POWER
             10 BINARY_ADD
             11 RETURN_VALUE
Tip: Python bytecode


COOL!
